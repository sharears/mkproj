# mkproj

![mkproj workflow](images/mkproj_overview.png)

### One-command setup for reproducible research projects (local + GitHub)

---

## TL;DR

**`mkproj`** lets you start a clean, reproducible research project with **one command**.
It creates a standardized project structure, initializes Git safely, and synchronizes with GitHub **without uploading data**.
Run `mkproj <project_name>` and start working—no Git setup, no folder chaos.

## Why this workflow matters

### 1️⃣ Reproducibility starts at project creation

Many reproducibility problems begin before analysis even starts—unclear folder structures, mixed data and code, or missing documentation.
This workflow enforces a clean separation between **data, code, results, and logs from day one**, making reproducibility a default rather than an afterthought.

### 2️⃣ It removes Git friction for researchers

Git errors, merge conflicts, and accidental data uploads are common pain points, especially for new lab members.
`mkproj` automates best practices (correct `.gitignore`, safe merges, license handling), allowing users to focus on **scientific reasoning instead of version-control mechanics**.

### 3️⃣ It scales from a single project to an entire lab

By standardizing how projects are created, this workflow creates a shared structure and mental model across the lab.
Students, postdocs, and collaborators can move between projects without relearning conventions, simplifying onboarding and long-term maintenance.

## What this tool is (and is not)

### ✅ What it does

* standardizes project setup
* enforces good Git hygiene
* keeps data out of GitHub
* works with private or public repositories
* supports later transfer to a lab organization

### ❌ What it does NOT do

* upload raw data
* track results or generated files
* modify existing projects
* rewrite Git history

GitHub is used **only for code, documentation, and logs**.

---

## Repository contents

```
mkproj/
├── README.md
├── mkproj.sh    # project creation logic
└── install.sh   # installs mkproj into your shell
```

* `mkproj.sh` contains the `mkproj` function
* `install.sh` installs that function into `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`

---

## Requirements

### Required

* **Git**

  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

* **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**

  ```bash
  gh --version
  ```

### Not required

* GitHub Desktop
* SSH keys (HTTPS is used)

---

## Platform compatibility

This workflow is **cross-platform** and works on all major operating systems **as long as a POSIX-compatible shell is available**.

### Supported platforms

* **macOS**

  * Default shell: `zsh`
  * Fully supported

* **Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Arch, HPC systems)

  * Default shell: `bash`
  * Fully supported

* **Windows** (with a Linux-like shell)

  * **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** — recommended
  * **Git Bash** — supported

### Not supported

* Windows **PowerShell**
* Windows **CMD**

---

## Installation (one-time)

### Step 1: Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mkproj.git
cd mkproj
```

### Step 2: Run the installer

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This appends the `mkproj` function to your shell configuration file:

* `~/.zshrc` (zsh)
* `~/.bashrc` (bash)

### Step 3: Reload your shell

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
```

---

## First-time GitHub authentication (one-time)

Run:

```bash
gh auth login
```

When prompted, choose:

* **GitHub.com**
* **HTTPS**
* **Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials → Yes**
* **Login with a web browser**

Verify:

```bash
gh auth status
```

---

## Everyday usage

To start a new project:

```bash
mkproj my_new_project
```

That’s it.

---

## Project folder structure (generated by `mkproj`)

```
my_new_project/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── intermediate/
│   └── processed/
├── scripts/
├── notebooks/
├── metadata/
├── results/
└── logs/
```

### Folder descriptions

* **`README.md`** — project overview and usage
* **`.gitignore`** — prevents tracking large or derived files
* **`data/`** — local data only (never uploaded)

  * `raw/` — original input data
  * `intermediate/` — temporary processing files
  * `processed/` — cleaned, analysis-ready data
* **`scripts/`** — reusable analysis and processing code
* **`notebooks/`** — exploratory Jupyter notebooks
* **`metadata/`** — data dictionaries and mappings
* **`results/`** — derived outputs (not tracked)
* **`logs/`** — daily analysis notes (`run_log.md`)

---

## Recommended daily workflow

```bash
git status
git add scripts notebooks metadata logs README.md
git commit -m "Describe what changed today"
git push
```

You generally do **not** commit data or results.

---

## Lab ownership and collaboration

* Projects can start under a **personal GitHub account**
* Repositories can later be **transferred to a lab organization**
* Commit history and license are preserved

---

## Safety guarantees

* no force-push
* no data uploads
* no history rewriting
* license-safe merges
* works offline until GitHub sync

---

## Who should use this?

* computational research labs
* graduate students and postdocs
* undergraduate research groups
* instructors teaching reproducible research
