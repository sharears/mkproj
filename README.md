### One-command setup for reproducible research projects (local + GitHub)

`mkproj` is a small command-line helper that lets you start a **new research project** with **one command**.

It automatically:

* creates a clean local project folder
* applies a standard, reproducible directory structure
* initializes Git safely
* creates or connects the matching GitHub repository
* merges and syncs local ↔ GitHub (license-safe)
* prevents large data from being uploaded

This tool is designed for **computational labs, students, and researchers** who want a simple, repeatable workflow without Git headaches.

---

## What this tool is (and is not)

### ✅ What it does

* standardizes project setup
* enforces good Git hygiene
* keeps data out of GitHub
* works with private or public repos
* supports later transfer to a lab organization

### ❌ What it does NOT do

* upload raw data
* track results or generated files
* modify existing projects
* rewrite Git history

GitHub is used **only for code, documentation, and logs**.

---

## Repository contents

```
mkproj/
├── README.md
├── mkproj.sh    # project creation logic
└── install.sh   # installs mkproj into your shell
```

* `mkproj.sh` contains the `mkproj` function
* `install.sh` installs that function into `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`

---

## Requirements

### Required

* **Git**

  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

* **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**

  ```bash
  gh --version
  ```

### Not required

* GitHub Desktop
* SSH keys (HTTPS is used)

---

## Installation (one-time)

### Step 1: Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mkproj.git
cd mkproj
```

### Step 2: Run the installer

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This appends the `mkproj` function to your shell configuration file:

* `~/.zshrc` (zsh)
* `~/.bashrc` (bash)

### Step 3: Reload your shell

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
```

---

## First-time GitHub authentication (one-time)

Run:

```bash
gh auth login
```

When prompted, choose:

* **GitHub.com**
* **HTTPS**
* **Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials → Yes**
* **Login with a web browser**

Verify:

```bash
gh auth status
```

---

## Everyday usage

To start a new project:

```bash
mkproj my_new_project
```

That’s it.

---

## Project folder structure (generated by `mkproj`)

When you run:

```bash
mkproj my_new_project
```

the following directory structure is created:

```
my_new_project/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── intermediate/
│   └── processed/
├── scripts/
├── notebooks/
├── metadata/
├── results/
└── logs/
```

### Folder descriptions

* **`README.md`**
  Top-level description of the project goals, scope, and usage.

* **`.gitignore`**
  Prevents large data files and derived outputs from being tracked by Git.

* **`data/`**
  Local data storage (never uploaded to GitHub).

  * **`raw/`** – original input data (read-only; never modified).
  * **`intermediate/`** – temporary files generated during processing.
  * **`processed/`** – cleaned, analysis-ready datasets.

* **`scripts/`**
  Reusable scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

* **`notebooks/`**
  Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and figure generation.

* **`metadata/`**
  Data dictionaries, sample mappings, and annotation files.

* **`results/`**
  Derived outputs such as figures and tables (not tracked in Git).

* **`logs/`**
  Daily analysis notes and run history (e.g., `run_log.md`).

---

### Tracking rules (important)

* **Tracked on GitHub:**
  `scripts/`, `notebooks/`, `metadata/`, `logs/`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`

* **Not tracked on GitHub:**
  `data/`, `results/`

This separation keeps repositories lightweight, reproducible, and safe.

---

## Recommended daily workflow

At the end of the day:

```bash
git status
git add scripts notebooks metadata logs README.md
git commit -m "Describe what changed today"
git push
```

You generally do **not** commit:

* data
* results
* generated files

---

## Lab ownership and collaboration

* Projects can start under a **personal GitHub account**
* Repositories can later be **transferred to a lab organization**
* Commit history and license are preserved

This is standard GitHub practice.

---

## Safety guarantees

* no force-push
* no data uploads
* no history rewriting
* license-safe merges
* works offline until GitHub sync

---

## Who should use this?

* computational research labs
* graduate students and postdocs
* undergraduate research groups
* instructors teaching reproducible research
